Challenge 1: Draw a shape diagonally across the canvas, in the shape of an "X"

I chose to draw a diagonal of white circles, with various colored strokes. I created two loops which drew each diagonal, and an array under the setup function with colors to be randomly chosen from. I used a function to input this array.


Challenge 2: Draw a grid of shapes with nested loops.

I chose to create a grid of circles for this challenge, which used nested loops to create rows and columns which placed ellipses across the canvas in a grid. I added a pink gradient element to the design, and removed the strokes from the ellipses to make it appear as though the ellipses faded into thin air.


Challenge 3: Add mouse interactivity.

Piggybacking off the previous sketch, I chose to make the gradient in my ellipses move depending on the placement of the user's mouse. Depending on the x and y coordinates of the mouse, the gradient moves from a light pink gradient to a white gradient.
